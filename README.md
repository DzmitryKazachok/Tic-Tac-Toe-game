# Tic-Tac-Toe-game

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os) is a classic two-player game. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. The players take turns putting their own marker (one player has the 'X' and the other has the 'O') into the empty squares.

The objective of the game is to be the first player to get 3 of their own marker in a row. This could be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is considered a draw if the entire grid is filled up and no player has achieved a row of 3.

Here are the rules:

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. The first player draws an 'X' in an empty square, and then the second player draws an 'O' in an empty square.

3. The players alternate turns until the game is over.

4. The game is over when either one of the players has drawn a line of three of their own marker (be it X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all squares are filled and no player has achieved this.

5. If all squares are filled and no player has achieved a line of three, the game is considered a draw.

Tic-tac-toe is a simple, yet strategic game that requires players to anticipate their opponent's moves and respond accordingly. It's a popular pastime due to its simplicity and the quick nature of the game.
